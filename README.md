# Multimodal Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews by leveraging multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and video. The integration of these diverse data types allows for a comprehensive understanding of user sentiment, enabling more accurate predictions than unimodal approaches.

---

## Features
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines textual, acoustic, and visual data for analysis.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Uses state-of-the-art models like BERT, CNNs, and LSTMs.
- **Dataset Support**: Compatible with benchmark datasets such as CMU-MOSEI or custom datasets.
- **Visualization**: Provides sentiment trend graphs and confusion matrices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- GPU support (optional but recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/multimodal-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd multimodal-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and prepare the dataset:
   - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Update the dataset path in the configuration file (if applicable).

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data for analysis:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```

### Model Training
Train the model using the provided script:
```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/train_config.json
```

### Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on the test set:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model_path models/saved_model.pth
```

### Visualization
Generate visualizations for the sentiment predictions:
```bash
python src/visualize.py
```

---

## Configuration
Modify the configuration files in the `configs/` directory to customize:
- Model architecture
- Hyperparameters
- Dataset paths

---

## Results
Sample outputs include:
- Sentiment accuracy: `85%`
- Confusion matrix:
